hmc_build_manager -- Manages the update and upgrade of HMC
==========================================================

Synopsis
--------

Updates the HMC by installing a corrective service package located on an FTP/SFTP/NFS server or HMC hard disk.

Upgrades the HMC by obtaining  the required  files  from a remote server or from the HMC hard disk. The files are transferred onto a special partition on the HMC hard disk. After the files have been transferred, HMC will boot from this partition and perform the upgrade.



Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- Python >= 3



Parameters
----------

  hmc_host (True, str, None)
    The ipaddress or hostname of HMC.


  hmc_auth (True, dict, None)
    Username and Password credential of HMC.


    username (True, str, None)
      Username of HMC to login.


    password (optional, str, None)
      Password of HMC.



  build_config (False, dict, None)
    Configuration parameters required for hmc update/upgrade.


    location_type (optional, str, None)
      The type of location which contains the corrective service ISO image Valid values are ``disk`` for the HMC hard disk, ``ftp`` for an FTP site, ``sftp`` for a secure FTP (SFTP) site, ``nfs`` for an NFS file system.


    hostname (optional, str, None)
      The host name or IP address of the remote server where the corrective service ISO image is located.


    userid (optional, str, None)
      The user ID to use to log in to the remote FTP or SFTP server. This option is required when the ISO image is located on a remote FTP or SFTP server Otherwise, this option is not valid.


    passwd (optional, str, None)
      The password to use to log in to the remote FTP or SFTP server. The *passwd* and *sshkey* options are mutually exclusive in case if *location_type=sftp*. This option is only valid when the ISO image is located on a remote FTP or SFTP server.


    sshkey_file (optional, str, None)
      The name of the file that contains the SSH private key. This option is only valid if *location_type=sftp*.


    mount_location (optional, str, None)
      The mount location defined on the NFS server where the corrective service ISO image is located. This option is valid only if *location_type=nfs*.


    build_file (optional, str, None)
      The name of the corrective service ISO image file. This  option  is required when the ISO image is located on the HMC hard disk, a remote FTP, SFTP, or NFS server. During upgrade of hmc, this option represent the host path where the network install image is kept, not the HMC local path. If *location_type=disk*, this option should be provided with the ansible control node path ISO file or network install image is kept.



  state (True, str, None)
    The desired build state of the target hmc.

    ``facts`` does not change anything on the HMC and returns current driver/build level of HMC.

    ``updated`` ensures the target HMC is updated with given corrective service ISO image.

    ``upgraded`` ensures the target HMC is upgraded with given upgrade files.





Notes
-----

.. note::
   - Upgrade with *location_type=disk* will not support for 870 and 910 release of HMC
   - Module will not satisfy the idempotency requirement of Ansible, even though it partially confirms it. For instance if the module is tasked to update/upgrade the HMC to the same level, it will still go ahead with the operation and finally the changed state will be reported as false.
